    "title": "OWLAPY: A Pythonic Framework for OWL Ontology Engineering",
    "summary": "In this paper, we introduce OWLAPY, a comprehensive Python framework for OWL ontology engineering. OWLAPY streamlines the creation, modification, and serialization of OWL 2 ontologies. It uniquely integrates native Python-based reasoners with support for external Java reasoners, offering flexibility for users. OWLAPY facilitates multiple implementations of core ontology components and provides robust conversion capabilities between OWL class expressions and formats such as Description Logics, Manchester Syntax, and SPARQL. It also allows users to define custom workflows to leverage large language models (LLMs) in ontology generation from natural language text. OWLAPY serves as a well-tested software framework for users seeking a flexible Python library for advanced ontology engineering, including those transitioning from Java-based environments. The project is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/dice-group/owlapy and on the Python Package Index (PyPI) at https://pypi.org/project/owlapy/ , with over 50,000 downloads at the time of writing.",

    "title": "Snowpark: Performant, Secure, User-Friendly Data Engineering and AI/ML Next To Your Data",
    "summary": "Snowflake revolutionized data analytics with an elastic architecture that decouples compute and storage, enabling scalable solutions supporting data architectures like data lake, data warehouse, data lakehouse, and data mesh. Building on this foundation, Snowflake has advanced its AI Data Cloud vision by introducing Snowpark, a managed turnkey solution that supports data engineering and AI and ML workloads using Python and other programming languages.\n  This paper outlines Snowpark's design objectives towards high performance, strong security and governance, and ease of use. We detail the architecture of Snowpark, highlighting its elastic scalability and seamless integration with Snowflake core compute infrastructure. This includes leveraging Snowflake control plane for distributed computing and employing a secure sandbox for isolating Snowflake SQL workloads from Snowpark executions. Additionally, we present core innovations in Snowpark that drive further performance enhancements, such as query initialization latency reduction through Python package caching, improved workload scheduling for customized workloads, and data skew management via efficient row redistribution. Finally, we showcase real-world case studies that illustrate Snowpark's efficiency and effectiveness for large-scale data engineering and AI and ML tasks.",

    "summary": "Jupyter notebooks are widely used for machine learning (ML) prototyping. Yet, few debugging tools are designed for ML code in notebooks, partly, due to the lack of benchmarks. We introduce JunoBench, the first benchmark dataset of real-world crashes in Python-based ML notebooks. JunoBench includes 111 curated and reproducible crashes with verified fixes from public Kaggle notebooks, covering popular ML libraries (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn) and notebook-specific out-of-order execution errors. JunoBench ensures reproducibility and ease of use through a unified environment that reliably reproduces all crashes. By providing realistic crashes, their resolutions, richly annotated labels of crash characteristics, and natural-language diagnostic annotations, JunoBench facilitates research on bug detection, localization, diagnosis, and repair in notebook-based ML development.",
