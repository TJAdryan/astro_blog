		<p><strong>The trivia or trivial stuff:</strong></p>

		<p>Why nextvaldata? The name is from the SQL function <code>nextval()</code>, maybe it is a case of just hearing something a lot but I thought it has a nice ring to it and sounds forward thinking.</p>

		<p><strong>Less formal Stuff:</strong></p>

		<p>I started this blog for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I genuinely believe in sharing knowledge, but let's face it, we forget most of what we learn, documenting it won't prevent that but it helps. Secondly, I wanted a space to explore data engineering and related topics with a bit more personality – maybe even <em>fun</em>, <del>probably</del> hopefully. Finally, I can't resist a good anecdote, so this will never be 100% technical content.</p>

		<p>Data is an incredibly broad and complex field, I am sure many of you have had the same experience of realizing there are too many things for one person to know. My goal here isn't just to present dry technical facts but to share the <em>how</em> and the <em>why</em>, we all want to have perfect projects that perform flawlessly but that isn't true for most of us.</p>

		<p><strong>Other Stuff:</strong></p>

		<p>I love New York City where I work and live and enjoy a bit of everything it has to offer. I have a distrust for automobiles, but when I do drive, I get the appeal. Maybe it is just the metaphor of spending all your time in a box, maybe it was reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Broker-Robert-Moses-Fall/dp/0394720245">The Power Broker by Robert Caro</a> at an impressionable time in my life. To be honest I think cars are a kind of evil.  Like many people, my contradictions probably say as much about me as my convictions. I love reading and there are just too many good books and not nearly enough time.</p>

		<p><strong>Hobbies & Interests:</strong></p>

		<p>When I'm not buried in data, you'll often find me walking around the city – there's something therapeutic about exploring different neighborhoods and discovering hidden gems. NYC is perfect for this; every walk reveals something new, whether it's a historic building I've never noticed or a great little café tucked away on a side street.</p>

		<p>I'm passionate about good food and love trying new restaurants, from hole-in-the-wall spots to places that have been perfecting their craft for decades. There's a real art to finding those places that do one thing exceptionally well, and the city is full of them.</p>

		<p>History fascinates me, particularly how past decisions continue to shape our present. Whether it's urban planning, technology, or policy, understanding the historical context helps make sense of why things are the way they are. It's probably why I enjoyed <em>The Power Broker</em> so much – it's a perfect example of how one person's vision can transform entire cities and regions for generations.  Other times I am just thinking about how pretty Sophio is, and the answer is usually "Very".</p>

		<p><strong>Tell me stuff:</strong></p>

		<p>I'm always keen to connect with fellow data enthusiasts! Feel free to reach out, I love a good story and I feel like most people have one or more to tell. I appreciate all feedback, I promise to read it all.</p>
