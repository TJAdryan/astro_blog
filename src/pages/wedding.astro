					The Wedding of Dominick and Sophio
				</h2>

				<p class="intro-text">
					It was a September day in Brooklyn that felt like a gift—the
					kind of weather where the sun is bright but the air is
					crisp, signaling the perfect start to something new. On this
					morning, the light seemed to shine specifically for Dominick
					and Sophio.

					They arrived at City Hall in the morning, ready to make
					their bond official. Sophio looked absolutely beautiful,
					radiating a happiness that lit up the room. Standing beside
					her, Dominick was the picture of pride and devotion; he
					couldn’t take his eyes off her. The ceremony was intimate
					and deeply moving. The Justice presiding over the vows was
					warm and affirming, setting a tone of genuine love for the
					proceedings.
				</p>

				<p>
					Sophio was surrounded by a tight circle of love. Her
					daughter stood close, witnessing the moment, alongside
					Sophio’s aunt, who offered a steady, supportive presence.
					Her friend Natalie stepped up as bridesmaid, ensuring
					everything was perfect. Interestingly, the normally chatty
					Gvantsa was there, but she was surprisingly quiet—perhaps
					overcome by the weight and beauty of the moment.
				</p>

				<hr class="heart-divider" />

				<p>
					There was only one shadow on the bright day: Sophio’s mother
					was far away in her home country of Georgia and could not
					attend. However, her spirit was felt in the love Sophio
					carried with her.
				</p>

				<p>
					After the vows were spoken and the papers signed, the couple
					stepped out into the Brooklyn air. They made their way to
					the parks near the Brooklyn Bridge for photographs. The city
					itself seemed to want to join the celebration. Wherever they
					walked, strangers stopped in their tracks, their faces
					lighting up. "Did you get married today?" people asked,
					followed immediately by warm smiles and genuine cries of
					"Congratulations!" The kindness of strangers made the day
					feel even more magical.
				</p>

				<p>
					The celebration moved to Manhattan as they took the train to
					14th Street. Walking west from 8th Avenue, they decided to
					stop for a quick bite in a utilitarian pizza dive. They
					couldn't help but laugh at the contrast—sitting in their
					formal wedding attire surrounded by paper plates and
					fluorescent lights. Dominick, wanting everything to be
					perfect, asked Sophio if she would prefer to go somewhere
					more upscale. She dismissed the idea out of hand, looking at
					him with a smile. <span class="quote"
						>"As long as we are together,"</span
					> she said.
				</p>

				<p>
					They continued their journey toward the water, walking
					through the Meatpacking District. The cobblestone streets,
					long transformed into a playground for the well-heeled,
					provided a stunning backdrop. As they walked, they received
					even more compliments and smiles from the fashionable
					crowds, who were charmed by the happy couple.
				</p>

				<p>
					They eventually reached Little Island, the new park floating
					above the Hudson. Here, the circle widened. Sophio’s friends
					Irinka and the two Gvantsas were there to celebrate. Her
					friend Tina even rushed over after work to make sure she
					didn’t miss the joy. They laughed and relaxed by the water,
					soaking in the skyline and the excitement of what was to
					come.
				</p>

				<hr class="heart-divider" />

				<p>
					As evening fell, it was time for the grand finale: the
					Dinner Cruise.
				</p>

				<p>
					Once they boarded the boat, the party truly began.
					Dominick’s world merged with Sophio’s as his friends Wen,
					Sabina, and Pete joined the festivities. It was a gathering
					of lifetimes, as Dominick’s childhood friends, Fumiyo and
					James, were there. Dominick felt very honored that James's
					mother, Judy, was able to attend the festivities. She
					encouraged Dominick to dance with Sophio, even though it
					isn't something he typically enjoys. Dominick smartly
					listened to Judy. Later, he was so happy that he had
					listened that he invited Judy onto the dance floor, and the
					three of them enjoyed several songs together. Even
					Elizabeth, Dominick’s former office mate, came to celebrate;
					she had always been a vocal supporter of Dominick’s
					relationship with Sophio, and seeing them married was a
					special moment for her.
				</p>

				<p>
					The night became a blur of joy. They ate, drank, and chatted
					as the city lights drifted by outside the windows. The
					energy was high, but it peaked when the band leader, a
					charismatic woman with a commanding presence, took the
					microphone. She paused the music and asked the crowd, "Did
					you two get married today?"
				</p>

				<p>
					When Dominick and Sophio said yes, the room erupted. The
					band struck up a special tribute song just for them.
					Everyone—friends from childhood, friends from work, family,
					and new acquaintances—formed a circle, dancing around the
					newlyweds. It was a great evening, a loud and joyous
					declaration of a quiet and devoted love.
