			<p>Welcome to my blog! I'm Dominick, and this is my personal blog. I love data, and learning new things and new ways of looking at the world.</p>

			<p>Professionally, I am working as a <strong>Senior Engineer</strong>, developing API integrations, automating reporting, and configuring and deploying cloud services. I'm lucky to be on a team with awesome and dedicated people, where we create solutions for a whole range of SaaS, PaaS, and legacy system challenges.</p>

			<p>Day-to-day, I get to use a lot of great technology like <strong>Python, SQL, Spark, and Airflow</strong> for data processing and orchestration. I work extensively with modern data platforms like <strong>Databricks, Snowflake, and Apache Iceberg</strong> for building data lakehouses. For performance-critical data transformations, I leverage libraries like <strong>Polars and PySpark</strong>.</p>

			<p>I specialize in healthcare data integration, with a focus on solving critical business challenges. In my work with LHCSAs and certified home health care agencies, I built data solutions that directly addressed issues like delayed payments and operational inefficiencies. I also have hands-on experience managing the technical infrastructure, having built and maintained a data platform that integrates APIs from over 2,000 devices to provide real-time support desk metrics.</p>

			<p>My projects involved creating robust systems to handle a wide range of data formats and standards, from on-premises legacy systems using EDI transactions to modern cloud-based solutions leveraging FHIR. I have specific expertise in the technical implementation and management of HHA Exchange, which was central to improving the flow of payment data.</p>

			<p>I often implement a Medallion Architecture to transform raw data from a bronze layer into refined, analytics-ready tables in the gold layer, ensuring data quality and reliability. By using an Event-Driven Architecture and Microservices, I can build highly scalable data services that process information in real-time, helping to unlock key business improvements. All of this runs on cloud platforms like GCP, Azure, and AWS.</p>
