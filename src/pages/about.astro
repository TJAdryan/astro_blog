				About Me
			</h2>
			<p>
				Welcome to my blog! I'm Dominick, and this is my personal blog.
				I love data, and learning new things and new ways of looking at
				the world.
			</p>

			<p>
				Professionally, I am working as a <strong
					>Senior Engineer</strong
				>, developing API integrations, automating reporting, and
				configuring and deploying cloud services. I'm lucky to be on a
				team with awesome and dedicated people, where we create
				solutions for a whole range of SaaS, PaaS, and legacy system
				challenges.
			</p>

			<p>
				Day-to-day, I get to use a lot of great technology like <strong
					>Python, SQL, Spark, and Dagster</strong
				> for data processing and orchestration. I work extensively with modern
				data platforms like <strong
					>Microsoft Fabric, Snowflake, and Apache Iceberg</strong
				> for building data lakehouses. For performance-critical data transformations,
				I leverage libraries like <strong>Polars and PySpark</strong>.
			</p>

			<p>
				I specialize in healthcare data integration, with a focus on
				solving critical business challenges. In my work with LHCSAs and
				certified home health care agencies, I built data solutions that
				directly addressed issues like delayed payments and operational
				inefficiencies. I also have hands-on experience managing the
				technical infrastructure, having built and maintained a data
				platform that integrates APIs from over 2,000 devices to provide
				real-time support desk metrics.
			</p>

			<p>
				My projects involved creating robust systems to handle a wide
				range of data formats and standards, from on-premises legacy
				systems using EDI transactions to modern cloud-based solutions
				leveraging FHIR. I have specific expertise in the technical
				implementation and management of HHA Exchange, which was central
				to improving the flow of payment data.
			</p>

			<p>
				I often implement a Medallion Architecture to transform raw data
				from a bronze layer into refined, analytics-ready tables in the
				gold layer, ensuring data quality and reliability. By using an
				Event-Driven Architecture and Microservices, I can build highly
				scalable data services that process information in real-time,
				helping to unlock key business improvements. My focus is always
				to create the best integration, remaining agnostic across
				on-premises, hybrid, and cloud deployments while leveraging
				platforms like GCP, Azure, and AWS to build scalable solutions.

		<p>
			Recently I've been exploring GPU-accelerated data processing to
			speed up ETL and analytics workloads. See my write-up <a
				href="/blog/2025-10-20-Getting -70x-Data-Processing-Speed-with-GPU-vs-CPU"
				>"Getting -70x Data Processing Speed with GPU vs CPU"</a
			> for benchmarks, links to the <a
				href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit">CUDA Toolkit</a
			>, and recommended tooling such as <a href="https://rapids.ai/"
				>RAPIDS</a
			> and <a href="https://triton-lang.org/">Triton</a>. If you'd like
			to reproduce my environment locally, I include example conda
			commands and a RAPIDS-compatible environment in that post.

			Interactive Housing Simulation (React)
		</h3>
		<p>
			I built an interactive housing market simulation as a small React
			app embedded in this site. It demonstrates agent-based dynamics and
			lets you tweak parameters to see how supply, demand, and simple
			policy changes affect outcomes. The simulation lives in <code
				>src/components/HousingSim/HousingSimulation.jsx</code
			> and is mounted on the page <a href="/housing_simulation"
				>Housing Simulation</a
			>. You can also view the component source on GitHub: <a
				href="https://github.com/TJAdryan/astro_blog/blob/main/src/components/HousingSim/HousingSimulation.jsx"
				>HousingSimulation.jsx</a
			>.
		</p>
		<p>
			To run the simulation locally: clone the repo, install dependencies,
			and run the dev server. The simulation uses the Astro + React
			integration and is mounted with client-only React hydration so the
			UI is interactive in the browser.
