				<p>Welcome to my blog! I'm Dominick, and this is my personal blog. I love data, and learning new things and new ways of looking at the world.</p>

				<p>Professionally, I am working as a <strong>Senior Engineer</strong>, developing API integrations, automating reporting, and configuring and deploying cloud services. I'm lucky to be on a team with awesome and dedicated people, where we create solutions for a whole range of SaaS, PaaS, and legacy system challenges.</p>

				<p>Day-to-day, I get to use a lot of great technology like <strong>Python, SQL, Spark, and Airflow</strong> for data processing and orchestration. I work extensively with modern data platforms like <strong>Databricks, Snowflake, and Apache Iceberg</strong> for building data lakehouses. For performance-critical data transformations, I leverage libraries like <strong>Polars and PySpark</strong>.</p>

				<p>I specialize in healthcare data integration, with a focus on solving critical business challenges. In my work with LHCSAs and certified home health care agencies, I built data solutions that directly addressed issues like delayed payments and operational inefficiencies. I also have hands-on experience managing the technical infrastructure, having built and maintained a data platform that integrates APIs from over 2,000 devices to provide real-time support desk metrics.</p>

				<p>My projects involved creating robust systems to handle a wide range of data formats and standards, from on-premises legacy systems using EDI transactions to modern cloud-based solutions leveraging FHIR. I have specific expertise in the technical implementation and management of HHA Exchange, which was central to improving the flow of payment data.</p>

				<p>I often implement a Medallion Architecture to transform raw data from a bronze layer into refined, analytics-ready tables in the gold layer, ensuring data quality and reliability. By using an Event-Driven Architecture and Microservices, I can build highly scalable data services that process information in real-time, helping to unlock key business improvements. My focus is always to create the best integration, remaining agnostic across on-premises, hybrid, and cloud deployments while leveraging platforms like GCP, Azure, and AWS to build scalable solutions.</p>

				<h3 style="color: var(--accent); margin-top: 0;">GPU / CUDA work</h3>
				<p>Recently I've been exploring GPU-accelerated data processing to speed up ETL and analytics workloads. See my write-up <a href="/blog/2025-10-20-Getting -70x-Data-Processing-Speed-with-GPU-vs-CPU">"Getting -70x Data Processing Speed with GPU vs CPU"</a> for benchmarks, links to the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit">CUDA Toolkit</a>, and recommended tooling such as <a href="https://rapids.ai/">RAPIDS</a> and <a href="https://triton-lang.org/">Triton</a>. If you'd like to reproduce my environment locally, I include example conda commands and a RAPIDS-compatible environment in that post.</p>

				<h3 style="color: var(--accent); margin-top: 0;">Interactive Housing Simulation (React)</h3>
				<p>I built an interactive housing market simulation as a small React app embedded in this site. It demonstrates agent-based dynamics and lets you tweak parameters to see how supply, demand, and simple policy changes affect outcomes. The simulation lives in <code>src/components/HousingSim/HousingSimulation.jsx</code> and is mounted on the page <a href="/housing_simulation">Housing Simulation</a>. You can also view the component source on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/TJAdryan/astro_blog/blob/main/src/components/HousingSim/HousingSimulation.jsx">HousingSimulation.jsx</a>.</p>
				<p>To run the simulation locally: clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the dev server. The simulation uses the Astro + React integration and is mounted with client-only React hydration so the UI is interactive in the browser.</p>
