			<p>Welcome to my blog! I'm Dominick, and this is my personal blog. I love data, and learning new things and new ways of looking at the world.</p>

			<p>Professionally, I am working as a <strong>Senior Engineer</strong>, developing API integrations, automating reporting, and configuring and deploying cloud services. I'm lucky to be on a team with awesome and dedicated people, where we create solutions for a whole range of SaaS, PaaS, and legacy system challenges.</p>

			<p>Day-to-day, I get to use a lot of great technology like <strong>Python, SQL, Spark, and Airflow</strong> for data processing and orchestration. I work extensively with modern data platforms like <strong>Databricks, Snowflake, and Apache Iceberg</strong> for building data lakehouses. For performance-critical data transformations, I leverage libraries like <strong>Polars and PySpark</strong>.</p>

			<p>I specialize in healthcare data integration, building solutions that solve complex data challenges. My work with LHCSAs and certified home health care agencies involves moving data from both on-premises and cloud-based systems, allowing me to build hybrid data solutions. I have specific experience with HHA Exchange and leveraging standards such as EDI transactions and HL7 FHIR.</p>

			<p>My projects often follow a Medallion Architecture, where I transform raw data from a bronze layer into refined, analytics-ready tables in the gold layer. I've also implemented an Event-Driven Architecture to handle real-time data streams and leveraged Microservices for building distributed and scalable data services. This approach allows me to combine the flexibility of a data lakehouse with the governance of a traditional data warehouse. All of this runs on cloud platforms like GCP, Azure, and AWS.</p>
