# Housing Market Simulation Instructions

## How to Use the Housing Market Simulation

1. **Adjust Simulation Inputs**
   - Use the input boxes at the top to set:
     - **Sale Turnover (%)**: The percent of homes that go up for sale each year.
     - **New Homes / Year**: How many new homes are built each year.
     - **Initial Seekers**: Number of people/families looking for housing at the start.
     - **Landlord Cap (%)**: The maximum percent of homes that can be owned by landlords.
     - **Homeowners**: Initial number of homes owned by homeowners.
     - **Landlords**: Initial number of homes owned by landlords.
     - **Years to Run**: How many years the simulation will run when started.

2. **Run or Pause the Simulation**
   - Click the **Run** button to start the simulation. The button will change to **Pause** while running.
   - Click **Pause** to stop the simulation at any time.

3. **Advance Year or Reset**
   - Use **Advance Year** to step forward one year at a time (only when paused).
   - Use **Reset** to return all settings and the simulation to their starting values.

4. **Trigger Mortgage Collapse**
   - Click **Trigger Mortgage Collapse** to simulate a year with a high rate of foreclosures (only available when paused).

5. **View Results**
   - The dashboard shows:
     - Current market stats (population, seekers, home prices, rents, incomes, etc.).
     - A visual grid of all homes, color-coded by status and type.
     - Cumulative market activity (purchases, conversions, displacements).

6. **Legend**
   - Colored dots explain the meaning of each home type/status in the visual grid.
