  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Exploring the Simulation: A Guide</h2>
  <p>This isn't just a game; it's a model of the feedback loops that can lead to a housing crisis. By adjusting the inputs, you can see how different market conditions and policy choices create vastly different outcomes for the people living in the economy.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. The Controls: Setting the Scenario</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>New Homes / Year</strong>: Sets the <em>potential</em> number of new homes the market tries to build. As you'll see, this is not always how many actually get built.</li>
    <li><strong>Landlord Cap (%)</strong>: The "Investor Monopoly Cap." This models the regulatory or political ceiling that prevents one class of owner from completely taking over the market.</li>
    <li><strong>Sale Turnover (%)</strong>: The percentage of existing homes that go up for sale each year from normal life events.</li>
    <li><strong>Initial Seekers, Homeowners, Landlords</strong>: These set the starting conditions of the market.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. The Dashboard: Reading the Results</h3>
  <p>The metrics are grouped to tell a story. Watch how the sections influence each other.</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3">
    <li>
      <strong>Current Market Stats</strong>: This is the high-level overview. Pay close attention to <strong>Seeking Housing</strong> (the number of households left behind) and the <strong>Median Rent Burden</strong> (the affordability crisis).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Political & Supply Metrics</strong>: This is the engine of the crisis. Watch how a rising <strong>Landlord Concentration</strong> directly causes the <strong>New Home Approval Rate</strong> to fall, creating an <strong>Annual Supply Deficit</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cumulative Market Activity</strong>: This section tracks the long-term consequences. <strong>Total Housing Not Built</strong> shows the permanent scar tissue on the housing supply, while <strong>Displacements</strong> and <strong>Pushed into Homelessness</strong> represent the human cost of market instability.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. The Visual Grid & Legend</h3>
  <p>The grid provides an at-a-glance view of the entire housing stock, grouped by type. The legend is as follows:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-4">
      <li><span class="inline-block w-4 h-4 rounded-full bg-green-500 mr-2 align-middle"></span>Owner Occupied</li>
      <li><span class="inline-block w-4 h-4 rounded-full bg-blue-800 mr-2 align-middle"></span>Rental Occupied</li>
      <li><span class="inline-block w-4 h-4 rounded-full bg-blue-400 mr-2 align-middle"></span>Rental Vacant</li>
  <li><span class="inline-block w-4 h-4 rounded-full bg-[#ffbf00] mr-2 align-middle"></span>Unsold Homes</li>
      <li><span class="inline-block w-4 h-4 rounded-full bg-purple-500 mr-2 align-middle"></span>Short-Term Rental</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mt-2">The "Unsold Homes" category is critical. It represents a stalled development pipelineâ€”homes built at a price point the general population can no longer afford.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What to Watch For</h3>
  <p>To see the core feedback loop, try this: set the <strong>Landlord Cap</strong> high (e.g., 45%) and run the simulation for 30+ years. You will likely see:</p>
  <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Landlords use their "cash offer" advantage to acquire more property, increasing their <strong>Concentration</strong>.</li>
      <li>This concentration suppresses the <strong>New Home Approval Rate</strong>.</li>
      <li>The lack of new supply causes the <strong>Seeking Housing</strong> pool to swell.</li>
      <li>The huge number of seekers causes <strong>Median Home Price</strong> and <strong>Median Rent</strong> to skyrocket, completely detaching from incomes.</li>
      <li>This results in a "failed market" with high vacancy, high prices, and a massive population unable to find a home.</li>
  </ol>
